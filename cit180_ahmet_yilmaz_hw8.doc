
I have decided to create a database for a hotel, because I work in a hotel. There are departments, managemrs, and employees, with their titles and salaries in a hotel.

Departments(employeeNr(FK), departmentID(PK), departmentName(FK))
Managers(employeeNr(PK)(FK),departmentID(FK)
Employees(employeeNr(PK), empFirstName, empLastName)
Titles(employeeNr(PK)(FK), title)
Salaries(employeeNr(PK)(FK), salary)


					____	Departments
						departmentID CHAR(4)
						departmentName VARCHAR (50)
					
Salaries
employeeNr INT(10)
salary INT(10)

				Employees
			_____	employeeNr INT(10)
			_____	empFirstName VARCHAR(50)
				empLastName VARCHAR(50)

Titles	
employeeNr INT(10)
title VARCHAR(50)	
					____	Managers
						employeeNr INT(10)
						departmentID CHAR(4)



CREATE TABLE Employees
(
employeeNR INT NOT NULL,
empFirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
empLastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (employeeNr)
);


CREATE TABLE Departments
(
employeeNR INT NOT NULL,
departmentID CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
departmentName VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (departmentID)
FOREIGN KEY (departmentName ) REFERENCES Departments
FOREIGN KEY (employeeNr) REFERENCES Employees
);

CREATE TABLE Managers
(
employeeNr INT(10) NOT NULL,
departmentID CHAR (4) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (employeeNr)
FOREIGN KEY (departmentID) REFERENCES Departments
FOREIGN KEY employeeNr) REFERENCES Employees
);


CREATE TABLE Titles
(
employeeNr INT(10) NOT NULL,
title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (employeeNr) 
FOREIGN KEY (employeeNr) REFERENCES Employees
);

CREATE TABLE Salaries
(
employeeNr INT(10) NOT NULL,
salary INT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (employeeNr) 
FOREIGN KEY (employeeNr) REFERENCES Employees
);

insert into Departments values(01, "AA")

insert into Departments values(02, "AB")

insert into Departments values(03, "AC")

insert into Departments values(04, "AD")

insert into Employees values(1, 'Ahmet', "Yilmaz')

insert into Employees values(2, 'John', 'Smith')

insert into Employees values(3, 'Mike', 'Jones')

insert into Employees values(4, 'Scott', 'Kulinsky')

insert into Managers values(01, 001)

insert into Managers values(02, 002)

insert into Managers values(03, 003)

insert into Managers values(04, 004)
